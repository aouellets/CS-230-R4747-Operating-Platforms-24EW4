Project Overview
The Gaming Room - Draw It or Lose It
Client: The Gaming Room

Project Summary: The project aimed to expand the Android-based game "Draw It or Lose It" into a web-based application to serve multiple platforms. Inspired by the 1980s television game "Win, Lose or Draw," this game revolves around teams guessing puzzles based on images rendered from a stock drawing library. The web-based version aims to maintain the engaging essence of the game while making it accessible across various devices and platforms.

Reflection
What I Did Well
In developing the software design documentation, I excelled in structuring a clear and comprehensive design that meets and anticipates the client’s needs. The use of design patterns like Singleton and Iterator helped ensure efficient and effective management of game state and operations.

Design Document Process Benefits
The detailed design document was instrumental in laying a solid foundation for the development phase, providing a roadmap that guided the coding process to ensure all functionalities align with the client's expectations.

Area for Revision
I would enhance the evaluation section to include more robust testing scenarios and user feedback loops, ensuring the application meets user expectations and usability standards.

Interpreting User Needs
User needs were interpreted through interactive sessions with the client and by analyzing the market competition. Prioritizing these needs in the software design was crucial for ensuring the application’s relevance and user satisfaction.

Design Approach
I focused on modular, scalable, and maintainable design principles. For future projects, I will continue to leverage frameworks and tools that support these principles, ensuring rapid adaptability and robust application performance.

Operating Platform and System Architecture
Recommended Operating Platform: Linux was chosen as the primary operating system for its robust performance, security features, and scalability, which are crucial for handling the high-traffic, multiplayer online game.

System Architecture: The system architecture employs a microservices approach, allowing for effective load balancing and easy scaling. This architecture supports continuous integration and deployment practices which are essential for maintaining high availability and performance.

Memory Management
Memory Management Techniques: Linux efficiently handles memory through techniques like paging, swapping, and virtual memory allocation, reducing latency and increasing the efficiency of memory use. This is critical for maintaining game performance during peak user interactions.

Distributed Systems and Networks
Communication Protocols: REST over HTTP/HTTPS was used to ensure secure, stateless communication across services, essential for the game’s client-server architecture. This approach enhances scalability and simplifies interactions between distributed systems.

Security
Security Measures: Employing AWS security tools, including AWS IAM and KMS, ensured that data encryption and access control policies were robustly implemented to protect user information and comply with data protection regulations.
